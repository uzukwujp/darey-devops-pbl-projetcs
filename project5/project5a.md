Client-Server Architecture with MySQL
=====================================

#### Understanding Client-Server Architecture

As you proceed your journey into the world of IT, you will begin to realise that certain concepts apply to many other areas. One of such concepts is -  [Client-Server architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clientâ€“server_model).

Client-Server refers to an architecture in which two or more computers are connected together over a network to send and receive requests between one another. 

In their communication, each machine has its own role: the machine sending requests is usually referred as "Client" and the machine responding (serving) is called "Server". 

A simple diagram of Web Client-Server architecture is presented below:

In the example above, a machine that is trying to access a Web site using Web browser or simply 'curl' command is a client and it sends HTTP requests to a Web server (Apache, Nginx, IIS or any other) over the Internet. 

If we extend this concept further and add a Database Server to our architecture, we can get this picture:

In this case, our Web Server has a role of a "Client" that connects and reads/writes to/from a Database (DB) Server (MySQL, MongoDB, Oracle, SQL Server or any other), and the communication between them happens over a Local Network (it can also be Internet connection, but it is a common practice to place Web Server and DB Server close to each other in local network). 

The setup on the diagram above is a typical generic Web Stack architecture that you have already implemented in previous projects (LAMP, LEMP, MEAN, MERN), this architecture can be implemented with many other technologies - various Web and DB servers, from small Single-page applications [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) to large and complex portals.

#### Real example of LAMP website

In **Project 1** you implemented a **LAMP STACK** website, let us take an example of commercially deployed LAMP website - `www.propitixhomes.com`. 

This **LAMP** website server(s) can be located anywhere in the world and you can reach it also from any part of the globe over global network - Internet.

Assuming that you go on your browser, and typed in there `www.propitixhomes.com`. It means that your browser is considered the "**Client**". Essentially, it is sending request to the remote server, and in turn, would be expecting some kind of response from the remote server. 

Lets take a very quick example and see Client-Server communicatation in action.

Open up your Ubuntu or Windows terminal and run `curl` command: 

```
$ curl -Iv www.propitixhomes.com
```

**Note:** If your Ubuntu does not have 'curl', you can install it by running `sudo apt install curl`

In this example, your terminal will be the **client**, while `www.propitixhomes.com` will be the **server**. 

See the response from the remote server in below output. You can also see that the requests from the URL are being served by a computer with an IP address `160.153.133.153` on port `80`. *More on IP addresses and ports when we get to Networking related projects*

Another simple way to get a server's IP address is to use a simple diagnostic tool like 'ping', it will also show round-trip time - time for packets to go to and back from the server, this tool uses [ICMP protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol).

#### Side Self Study 

1. Read about [ping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility)) and [traceroute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traceroute) network diagnostic utilities. Be able to make sense out of the results of using these tools.
2. Refresh your knowledge of [basic SQL commands](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/), be able to perform simple SHOW, CREATE, DROP, SELECT and INSERT SQL queries.
