# MEAN Stack Deployment to Ubuntu in AWS

Now, when you have already learned how to deploy **LAMP**, **LEMP** and **MERN** Web stacks - it is time to get yourself familiar with **MEAN** stack and deploy it to Ubuntu server.

#### MEAN Stack is a combination of following components:

1. [**M**ongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) (Document database) - Stores and allows to retrieve data.
2. [**E**xpress](https://expressjs.com) (Back-end application framework) - Makes requests to Database for Reads and Writes.
3. [**A**ngular](https://angular.io) (Front-end application framework) - Handles Client and Server Requests
4. [**N**ode.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (JavaScript runtime environment) - Accepts requests and displays results to end user

#### Side Self Study

1. Refresh your knowledge of [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model)
2. Read about [Load Balancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)), get yourself familiar with different types and techniques of traffic load balancing.
3. Practice in editing simple web forms with [HTML + CSS + JS](https://html-css-js.com)

#### Instructions On How To Submit Your Work For Review And Feedback

To submit your work for review and feedback - follow [**this instruction**](https://starter-pbl.darey.io/en/latest/submission.html).

#### Step 0 - Preparing prerequisites

In order to complete this project you will need an AWS account and a virtual server with Ubuntu Server OS.

If you do not have an AWS account - go back to **[Project 1 Step 0](https://starter-pbl.darey.io/en/latest/project1.html)** to sign in to AWS free tier account ans create a new EC2 Instance of t2.nano family with Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS (HVM) image. Remember, you can have multiple EC2 instances, but make sure you **STOP** the ones you are not working with at the moment to save available free hours.

**Hint:** In previous projects we used different tools to connect to an EC2 instance, but if you do not want to install or launch anything outside of AWS, you can open youc CLI straight from Web Console in AWS, like this:
