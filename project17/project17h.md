### Storage and Database

Useful Terraform Documentation, go through this documentation and understand the arguement needed for each of the resources:

- [RDS](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/db_subnet_group)
- [EFS](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/efs_file_system)
- [KMS](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/kms_key)
#### Create Elastic File System (EFS)

In order to create an EFS you need to create a [KMS key](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/getting-started/).

AWS Key Management Service (KMS) makes it easy for you to create and manage cryptographic keys and control their use across a wide range of AWS services and also in your applications.

Add the following code to `efs.tf`

```
# create key from key management system
resource "aws_kms_key" "ACS-kms" {
  description = "KMS key "
  policy      = <<EOF
  {
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Id": "kms-key-policy",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Enable IAM User Permissions",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::${var.account_no}:user/segun" },
      "Action": "kms:*",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
EOF
}

# create key alias
resource "aws_kms_alias" "alias" {
  name          = "alias/kms"
  target_key_id = aws_kms_key.ACS-kms.key_id
}

```



Let us create EFS and it's mount targets: Add the following code to `efs.tf`

```
# create Elastic file system
resource "aws_efs_file_system" "ACS-efs" {
  encrypted  = true
  kms_key_id = aws_kms_key.ACS-kms.arn

  tags = merge(
    var.tags,
    {
      Name = "ACS-efs"
    },
  )
}



# set first mount target for the EFS 
resource "aws_efs_mount_target" "subnet-1" {
  file_system_id  = aws_efs_file_system.ACS-efs.id
  subnet_id       = aws_subnet.private[2].id
  security_groups = [aws_security_group.datalayer-sg.id]
}


# set second mount target for the EFS 
resource "aws_efs_mount_target" "subnet-2" {
  file_system_id  = aws_efs_file_system.ACS-efs.id
  subnet_id       = aws_subnet.private[3].id
  security_groups = [aws_security_group.datalayer-sg.id]
}


# create access point for wordpress
resource "aws_efs_access_point" "wordpress" {
  file_system_id = aws_efs_file_system.ACS-efs.id

  posix_user {
    gid = 0
    uid = 0
  }

  root_directory {
    path = "/wordpress"

    creation_info {
      owner_gid   = 0
      owner_uid   = 0
      permissions = 0755
    }

  }

}


# create access point for tooling
resource "aws_efs_access_point" "tooling" {
  file_system_id = aws_efs_file_system.ACS-efs.id
  posix_user {
    gid = 0
    uid = 0
  }

  root_directory {

    path = "/tooling"

    creation_info {
      owner_gid   = 0
      owner_uid   = 0
      permissions = 0755
    }

  }
}

```
