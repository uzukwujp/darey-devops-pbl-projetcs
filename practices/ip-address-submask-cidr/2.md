# Subnetting and Subnet Masks


##### What is Subnetting?
Subnetting is the practice of dividing a network into two or smaller networks. It increases routing efficiency, which helps to enhance the security of the network and reduces the size of the broadcast domain.

IP Subnetting designates high-order bits from the host as part of the network prefix. This method divides a network into smaller subnets.

It also helps you to reduce the size of the routing tables, which is stored in routers. This method also helps you to extend the existing IP address base & restructures the IP address.

What is Subnet Mask?
A subnet mask is a 32 bits address used to distinguish between a network address and a host address in IP address. A subnet mask identifies which part of an IP address is the network address and the host address. They are not shown inside the data packets traversing the Internet. They carry the destination IP address, which a router will match with a subnet.
