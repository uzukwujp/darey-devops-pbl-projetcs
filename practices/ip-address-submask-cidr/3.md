## CIDR Notation and Address Aggregation


##### What is CIDR?
Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is an IP address allocation method that improves data routing efficiency on the internet. Every machine, server, and end-user device that connects to the internet has a unique number, called an IP address, associated with it. Devices find and communicate with one another by using these IP addresses. Organizations use CIDR to allocate IP addresses flexibly and efficiently in their networks.


##### IP Address Aggregator

IP Address Aggregator is a utility developed to automate minimization process and convert bunch of IPv4 addresses into smallest continuous range(s) possible. IP aggregation is commonly performed by network engineers working with BGP & routers. This utility will help webmasters to configure server firewalls, apache .htaccess files, address masks and so on.

##### Basic Usage

IP Address Aggregation Tool accepts various IP address formats for input (scroll to Input Format Examples for more details). Enter IP Address list in a block of text (one IP Address or range per line) into IP Address Ranges input area. Select desired output format and click submit button. It will automatically discard any non-recognized or invalid address text.
