 ## Working with Branches
 Imagine you have a note book and you want to write different story on different pages of your note book so that you do not mess up your previous note.

 git branch helps you create a different copy(page) of your source code. In your new branch you can make changes as you please. Your change is independent of what is available in the main copy.

 Git branch is commonly used to develop new feature of your application. You will agree with me that the initial code is untested and as such can not be added to the code base of your live application.

 Git branch is also an important tool for collaboration within remote teams(developers working from different location). They can make separate branches while working on same feature. And at the end of the day, converge their code to one branch.

 ### Make you first git Branch
 To make a new branch run this command: `git checkout -b <your branch name>
 
 The -b flag helps your create and change into the new branch

 With that said lets make our first branch following these steps:
 - Having made your first commit in the previous lesson

 - Make a new branch by running this command `git checkout -b my-new-branch`

### Listing your git Branches

### Change into an Old Branch

To change into an exiting or old branch use the command below:

```
 git checkout <branch-name>

```

### Merging a Branch into another Branch
Lets say we have two branches A and B. And we want to add the content of branch B into A.

First we change into branch A and run the git command below:

```
 git merge B

```

This is by no means all that you can do with branches in git. To learn more type the command `git branch --help` on your terminal.
