## Collaboration and Remote Repositories

Lets take a moment to recap about what we have learnt so far. We learnt that git is a distributed version control system. That essentially solves the problem sharing source code and tracking changes made to source code.

We then learnt about some operations like initializing git repository in our local machine, creating commit, branches etc.

We also mentioned in passing that git is used for collaboration among remote teams(developers residing in different location). But come to think of it how can developers working remotely collaborate(making changes, adding, updating etc) on the same code base since we currently have our code in our local computer.

This where **github** comes in.  Github is a web based platform where git repositores are hosted. By hosting our local git repository on github, it becomes available in the public internet(it is possible to create private repository as well). Anyone can now access it.

Remote teams can now view, update, and make changes to the same repository.
