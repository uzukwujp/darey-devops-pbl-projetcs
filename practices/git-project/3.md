## Collaboration and Remote Repositories

Lets take a moment to recap about what we have learnt so far. We learnt that git is a distributed version control system. That essentially solves the problem sharing source code and tracking changes made to source code.

We then learnt about some operations like initializing git repository in our local machine, creating commit, branches etc.

We also mentioned in passing that git is used for collaboration among remote teams(developers residing in different location). But come to think of it how can developers working remotely collaborate(making changes, adding, updating etc) on the same code base since we currently have our code in our local computer.

This where **github** comes in.  Github is a web based platform where git repositores are hosted. By hosting our local git repository on github, it becomes available in the public internet(it is possible to create private repository as well). Anyone can now access it.

Remote teams can now view, update, and make changes to the same repository.

### Creating a Github Account

step 1: Head over to [join github.com](https://github.com/join)

step 2: Next enter your username, password, and email

step 3: click the green button below to create your repository.

### Pushing your Local git Repository to your Remote github Repository.

In provious lessons, we have writting our story in our local git repository. Our friend is interested in contributing to our story but he is unable to do so because we currently have our story locally in our machine.

Having created a github account and a github repository in earlier steps, Lets send a copy of our story to our repository in github.

We will achieve this by following the steps bellow:

-  Add a remote repository to the local repository using the command below:

```
git remote add origin <link to your github repo>

```

To get the remote link click on the green button code, copy the https link. A screenshot is shown below.

-  After commiting your changes in your local repo. You push the content to the remote repo using the command below:

```
git push origin <branch name>

```

The word origin refers to your remote repo link, it evaluates to the remote repo url. It can be any word you choose. 


### Cloning Remote Git Repository

In the last Lesson, We successfully added a remote git repository and pushed our story in the local repository. Now our friend can now make contributions to our story.

Give it a thought, will he be working on our story on github directly on make a local copy?

Best practice dictates that he makes a copy of our story locally in his local machine, creates a branch where he can make all the modifications he sees fit.

But how is he going to make a local copy of our story in his loacl macheine? *Git clone* command to the rescue.

The git clone command helps us make a copy of remote repository in our local machine. See it as a git tool for downloading remote repository into our local machine. The command is as follows:

```
git clone <link to your remote repository>

```
