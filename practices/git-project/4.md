## Introduction to Markdown Syntax

Markdown syntax is a lightweight markup language that is widely used for formatting plain text. It allows you to add formatting elements to your text without using complex HTML or other formatting languages. Markdown is commonly used for creating documents, README files, forum posts, and even web pages.

Here is the most commonly used markdown syntax elements:

1. Headings: To create heading, use the hash symbol at the beginning of the line. The number of hash symbol used indicate the level of the heading.

```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

```

2. Emphasis: asterisks or underscore is used to Emphasis text

```
*italic* or _italic_
**bold** or __bold__

```

3. Lists: markdown has support for both ordered and unorderd list

unordered list example:

```
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

```

ordered list example:

```
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

```

4. Links: : To create a hyperlink, use square brackets for the link text followed by parentheses containing the URL.

example:

```
[visit darey.io](https://www.darey.io)

```

5. Images: To display an image, use an exclamation mark followed by square brackets for the alt text and parentheses containing the image URL.

```
![Alt Text](https://example.com/image.jpg)

```

6. Code: To display code or code snippets, use backticks (`) to enclose the code. 

example:

```
`console.log('Welcome to darey.io')`

```
