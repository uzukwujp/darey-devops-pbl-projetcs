### **1. sudo command:** 

Short for superuser do, sudo is one of the most popular basic Linux commands that lets you perform tasks that require administrative or root permissions.

When using sudo, the system will prompt users to authenticate themselves with a password. Then, the Linux system will log a timestamp as a tracker. By default, every root user can run sudo commands for 15 minutes/session.

If you try to run sudo in the command line without authenticating yourself, the system will log the activity as a security event.

Here’s the general syntax:

```
sudo (command e.g apt upgrade) 
```

so it becomes

```
sudo apt upgrade
```

You can also add an option, such as:

-k or –reset-timestamp invalidates the timestamp file.


-g or –group=group runs commands as a specified group name or ID.

-h or –host=host runs commands on the host.


### **2. pwd command:**

Use the pwd command to find the path of your current/present working directory. Simply entering pwd will return the full current path – a path of all the directories that starts with a forward slash (/). For example, /home/ubuntu.

The pwd command uses the following syntax:

```
pwd [option]
```

It has two acceptable options:

-L or –logical prints environment variable content, including symbolic links.

-P or –physical prints the actual path of the current directory.

```
pwd
```

#### **3. cd command:**

To navigate through the Linux files and directories, use the cd command. Depending on your current working directory, it requires either the full path or the directory name.

Running this command without an option will take you to the home folder. Keep in mind that only users with sudo privileges can execute it.

Let’s say you’re in /home/ubuntu and want to go to a new subdirectory of ubuntu. To do so, enter the following command:

```
cd CommandsLinux
```


If you want to switch to a completely new directory, for example, /home/ubuntu/CommandsLinux, you have to enter cd followed by the directory’s absolute path:

```
cd /home/ubuntu/CommandsLinux
or 
cd CommandsLinux
 ```

<img src="https://darey-io-pbl-projects-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/practices/images2/cd+CommandLinux.png" width="500px" height="80px">

Here are some shortcuts to help you navigate:

cd ~[username] goes to another user’s home directory.


`cd ..` moves one directory up.


`cd -` moves to your previous directory.

###  **4. ls command:**

The ls command lists files and directories within a system. Running it without a flag or parameter will show the current working directory’s content.

<img src="https://darey-io-pbl-projects-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/practices/images2/ls.png" width="500px" height="70px">

To see other directories’ content, type ls followed by the desired path. For example, to view files in the Documents folder, enter:
```
ls /home/ubuntu/Documents
```

<img src="https://darey-io-pbl-projects-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/practices/images2/ls+%3Ahome%3Aubuntu%3ADocuments.png" width="500px" height="90px">

Here are some options you can use with the ls command:

```
ls -R
``` 
lists all the files in the subdirectories


```
ls -a
``` 
shows hidden files in addition to the visible ones.

```
ls -lh
``` 
shows the file sizes in easily readable formats, such as KB, MB, GB, and TB.

###  **5. cat command:**

Concatenate, or cat, is one of the most frequently used Linux commands. It lists, combines, and writes file content to the standard output. To run the cat command, type cat followed by the file name and its extension. For instance:

```
cat sqlite_commands.sh
```

<img src="https://darey-io-pbl-projects-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/practices/images2/cat+sqlite_commands.sh.png" width="500px" height="200px">

Here are other ways to use the cat command ,you can try this on your own:
```
cat filename1.txt filename2.txt > filename3.txt
```
Merges filename1.txt and filename2.txt and stores the output in filename3.txt.
```
tac filename.txt 
```
displays content in reverse order.

###  **6. cp command:**

Use the cp command to copy files or directories and their content. Take a look at the following use cases.

To copy one file from the current directory to another, enter cp followed by the file name and the destination directory. For example:
```
cp sqlite_commands.sh /home/ubuntu/unixcommands
```

<img src="https://darey-io-pbl-projects-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/practices/images2/cp2.png" width="500px" height="110px">

To copy files to a directory, enter the file names followed by the destination directory: follow this format below 

```
cp filename1.txt filename2.txt filename3.txt /home/username/Documents
```

To copy the content of a file to a new file in the same directory, enter cp followed by the source file and the destination file as show below:
```
cp filename1.txt filename2.txt
```

To copy an entire directory, pass the -R flag before typing the source directory, followed by the destination directory:

```
cp -R /home/username/Documents /home/username/Documents_backup
```


###  **7. mv command:**

The primary use of the mv command is to move and rename files and directories. Additionally, it doesn’t produce an output upon execution.

Simply type `mv` followed by the filename and the destination directory. For example, you want to move  to the /home/username/Documents directory: for example
```
mv sqlite_commands.sh /home/ubuntu/CommandsLinux
```
<img src="https://darey-io-pbl-projects-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/practices/images2/mv_cmd1.png" width="500px" height="100px">

You can also use the mv command to rename a file:
```
mv sqlite_commands1.sh sql_commands.sh
```

<img src="https://darey-io-pbl-projects-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/practices/images2/mv_cmd2.png" width="500px" height="100px">

### **8. mkdir command:**
Use the mkdir command to create one or multiple directories at once and set permissions for each of them. The user executing this command must have the privilege to make a new folder in the parent directory, or they may receive a permission denied error.

Here’s the basic syntax:


```
mkdir [option] directory_name
```
For example, you want to create a directory called Music:

```
mkdir Music
```
<img src="https://darey-io-pbl-projects-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/practices/images2/mkdir.png" width="500px" height="40px">

To make a new directory called Songs inside Music, use this command:

```
mkdir Music/Songs
```
<img src="https://darey-io-pbl-projects-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/practices/images2/mkdir_2.png" width="500px" height="90px">

The mkdir command accepts many options, such as:

-p or –parents create a directory between two existing folders. 
For example, mkdir -p Music/2020/Songs will make the new “2020” directory.
-m sets the file permissions. For instance, to create a directory with full read, write, and execute permissions for all users, enter mkdir -m777 directory_name.
-v prints a message for each created directory.


### **9. rmdir command:**
To permanently delete an empty directory, use the rmdir command. Remember that the user running this command should have sudo privileges in the parent directory.

For example, you want to remove an empty subdirectory named Songs and its main folder Music:

```
rmdir -p Music/Songs
```
<img src="https://darey-io-pbl-projects-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/practices/images2/rmdir.png" width="500px" height="150px">

###  **10. rm command:**
The rm command is used to delete files within a directory. Make sure that the user performing this command has write permissions.

Remember the directory’s location as this will remove the file(s) and you can’t undo it.

Here’s the general syntax:

```
rm filename
```



To remove multiple files, enter the following command:
```
rm filename1 filename2 filename3
```


Here are some acceptable options you can add:

-i prompts system confirmation before deleting a file.
-f allows the system to remove without a confirmation.
-r deletes files and directories recursively.


### **11. touch command:**
The touch command allows you to create an empty file or generate and modify a timestamp in the Linux command line.

For example, enter the following command to create an HTML file named Web in the Documents directory:

touch sqlite_commands.sh

<img src="https://darey-io-pbl-projects-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/practices/images2/touch_cmd.png" width="500px" height="200px">

### **12. locate command:**

The locate command can find a file in the database system.

Moreover, adding the -i argument will turn off case sensitivity, so you can search for a file even if you don’t remember its exact name.

To look for content that contains two or more words, use an asterisk (*). For example:
```
locate -i school*note
```

The command will search for files that contain the words school and note, whether they use uppercase or lowercase letters.

### **13. find command:**

Use the find command to search for files within a specific directory and perform subsequent operations. Here’s the general syntax:
```
      find [option] [path] [expression]
```
You can edit to suit your case

For example, you want to look for a file called sql_commands.sh within the home directory and its subfolders:

```
find /home -name sql_commands.sh
```
<img src="https://darey-io-pbl-projects-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/practices/images2/find_1.png" width="500px" height="200px">

Here are other variations when using find:

find -name filename.txt to find files in the current directory.
find ./ -type d -name directoryname to look for directories.


### **14. grep command:**

Another basic Linux command on the list is grep or global regular expression print. It lets you find a word by searching through all the texts in a specific file.

Once the grep command finds a match, it prints all lines that contain the specific pattern. This command helps filter through large log files.

For example, you want to search for the word blue in the notepad.txt file:
```
grep values sql_commands.sh
```
The command’s output will display lines that contain blue.

### **15. df command:**
Use the df command to report the system’s disk space usage, shown in percentage and kilobyte (KB). Here’s the general syntax:
```
df [options] [file]
```
For example, enter the following command if you want to see the current directory’s system disk space usage in a human-readable format:
```
df -h
```
<img src="https://darey-io-pbl-projects-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/practices/images2/df+-h.png" width="500px" height="250px">


These are some acceptable options to use:

df -m displays information on the file system usage in MBs.
df -k displays file system usage in KBs.
df -T shows the file system type in a new column.

You can try all these on your own.

### **16. du command:**

If you want to check how much space a file or a directory takes up, use the du command. You can run this command to identify which part of the system uses the storage excessively.

Remember, you must specify the directory path when using the du command. For example, to check /home/ubuntu/CommandLinux enter:
```
du /home/ubuntu/CommandsLinux
```
<img src="https://darey-io-pbl-projects-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/practices/images2/du_cmd.png" width="500px" height="100px">

Adding a flag to the du command will modify the operation, such as:

-s offers the total size of a specified folder.
-m provides folder and file information in MB
k displays information in KB.
-h informs the last modification date of the displayed folders and files.

You can try all these on your own.

### **17. head command:**
The head command allows you to view the first ten lines of a text. Adding an option lets you change the number of lines shown. The head command is also used to output piped data to the CLI.

Here’s the general syntax:
```
head [option] [file]
```
For instance, you want to view the first ten lines of deploy1.yml, located in the current directory:
```
head deploy1.yml
```
<img src="https://darey-io-pbl-projects-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/practices/images2/head_cmd.png" width="600px" height="200px">

-n or –lines prints the first customized number of lines. For example, enter head -n 5 filename.txt to show the first five lines of filename.txt.
-c or –bytes prints the first customized number of bytes of each file.
-q or –quiet will not print headers specifying the file name.


### **18. tail command:**

The tail command displays the last ten lines of a file. It allows users to check whether a file has new data or to read error messages.

Here’s the general format:
```
tail [option] [file]
```

For example, you want to show the last ten lines of the deploy1.yml file:

```
tail -n 5 deploy1.yml
```
<img src="https://darey-io-pbl-projects-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/practices/images2/tail_cmd.png" width="600px" height="200px">

### **19. diff command:**

Short for difference, the diff command compares two contents of a file line by line. After analyzing them, it will display the parts that do not match.

Programmers often use the diff command to alter a program instead of rewriting the entire source code.

Here’s the general format:

```
diff [option] file1 file2
```

For example, you want to compare two  files – deploy1.yml and deploy2.yml

```
diff deploy1.yml deploy2.yml
```

<img src="https://darey-io-pbl-projects-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/practices/images2/diff_cmd.png" width="700px" height="180px">


Here are some acceptable options to add:

-c displays the difference between two files in a context form.
-u displays the output without redundant information.
-i makes the diff command case insensitive.

You can try these on your own.

### **20. tar command:**
The tar command archives multiple files into a TAR file – a common Linux format similar to ZIP, with optional compression.

Here’s the basic syntax:
```
tar [options] [archive_file] [file or directory to be archived]
```
For instance, you want to create a new TAR archive named newarchive.tar in the /home/ubuntu directory:

you can edit the code below to suit your purpose.

```
tar -cvf newarchive.tar /home/ubuntu
```

The tar command accepts many options, such as:
-x extracts a file.

-t lists the content of a file.

-u archives and adds to an existing archive file.
