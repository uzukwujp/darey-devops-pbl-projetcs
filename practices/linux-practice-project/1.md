**Linux** is a family of **open-source Unix** operating systems based on the Linux Kernel. They include Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, openSUSE, and Red Hat. Using Linux to manage a Virtual Private Server (VPS) is common practice.

When operating Linux, you need to use a shell – a program that gives you access to the operating system’s services. Most Linux distributions use a graphical user interface (GUI), making them beginner-friendly.

However, we recommend utilizing the **command-line interface (CLI)** because it’s quicker and offers more control. Tasks that require multiple steps on the GUI can be done in a matter of seconds by entering commands into the CLI.

So if you want to use Linux, learning the common utilities or commands will go a long way.

### **What Is a Linux Command?**
A Linux command is a program or utility that runs on the CLI – a console that interacts with the system via texts and processes. It’s similar to the Command Prompt application in Windows.

Linux commands are executed on Terminal by pressing Enter at the end of the line. You can run commands to perform various tasks, from package installation to user management and file manipulation.

Here’s what a Linux command’s general syntax looks like:

```
CommandName [option(s)] [parameter(s)]
```

A command may contain an ***option*** or a ***parameter***. In some cases, it can still run without them. These are the three most common parts of a command:

**CommandName** is the rule that you want to perform.
**Option or flag** modifies a command’s operation. To invoke it, use hyphens (–) or double hyphens (—).

Parameter or argument specifies any necessary information for the command.

###  **TAKE NOTE**

1. All Linux commands are case-sensitive


2. For persons who do not have access to a  linux machine you can access a light weight linux machine [here](https://bellard.org/jslinux/) free of charges

If you have clicked on the link above, pick a linux machine:
