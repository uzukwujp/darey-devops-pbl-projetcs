## Monitoring Infrastructure in AWS (Cloudwatch, Cloud trail)

Imagine you've just launched your startup's new application on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Excitedly, you see traffic start to flow in as users begin to interact with your service. However, with success comes responsibility. As your application grows, so does the complexity of managing its underlying infrastructure. How do you ensure that everything continues to run smoothly? How do you detect and address issues before they impact your users? This is where monitoring your infrastructure becomes crucial.

Monitoring, refers to the process of observing and collecting data about the performance, health, and behavior of systems, applications, networks, or infrastructure components. The primary goal of monitoring is to ensure that these systems operate effectively, efficiently, and securely, while also detecting and addressing any issues or anomalies in a timely manner.
