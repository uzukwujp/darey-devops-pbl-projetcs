 ## Directory Manipulation and Navigation

On the back of your lessons on Directory Manipulation and Navigation of Linux file system, We will be writing a simple shell script as a way of practicing what we learnt.

This script will display the current directory, create a new directory called "my_directory," change to that directory, create two files inside it, list the files, move back one level up, remove the "my_directory" and its contents, and finally list the files in the current directory again.

Proceed by following the steps bellow:

step 1: open a file named *navigating-linux-filesystem.sh*

step 2: paste the code block below:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Display current directory
echo "Current directory: $PWD"

# Create a new directory
echo "Creating a new directory..."
mkdir my_directory
echo "New directory created."

# Change to the new directory
echo "Changing to the new directory..."
cd my_directory
echo "Current directory: $PWD"

# Create some files
echo "Creating files..."
touch file1.txt
touch file2.txt
echo "Files created."

# List the files in the current directory
echo "Files in the current directory:"
ls

# Move one level up
echo "Moving one level up..."
cd ..
echo "Current directory: $PWD"

# Remove the new directory and its contents
echo "Removing the new directory..."
rm -rf my_directory
echo "Directory removed."

# List the files in the current directory again
echo "Files in the current directory:"
ls

```

step 3:  Run the command `sudo chmod +x navigating-linux-filesystem.sh` to set execute permission on the file

step 4: Run your script using this command `./navigating-linux-filesystem.sh`
