## File Backup and Timestamping

This shell scripting example is focused on file backup and timestamp. As a DevOps Engineer backing up databases and other storage devices is one of the most common task you get to carryout.

This script defines the source directory and backup directory paths. It then creates a timestamp using the current date and time, and creates a backup directory with the timestamp appended to its name. The script then copies all files from the source directory to the backup directory using the cp command with the -r option for recursive copying. Finally, it displays a message indicating the completion of the backup process and shows the path of the backup directory with the timestamp.

Lets proceed using the steps bellow:

step 1: On your terminal open a file *backup.sh* using the command `touch backup.sh`

step 2: Copy and paste the code block below into the file.

```
#!/bin/bash

# Define the source directory and backup directory
source_dir="/path/to/source_directory"
backup_dir="/path/to/backup_directory"

# Create a timestamp with the current date and time
timestamp=$(date +"%Y%m%d%H%M%S")

# Create a backup directory with the timestamp
backup_dir_with_timestamp="$backup_dir/backup_$timestamp"

# Create the backup directory
mkdir -p "$backup_dir_with_timestamp"

# Copy all files from the source directory to the backup directory
cp -r "$source_dir"/* "$backup_dir_with_timestamp"

# Display a message indicating the backup process is complete
echo "Backup completed. Files copied to: $backup_dir_with_timestamp"

```

step 3: Set execute permission on *backup.sh* using this command `sudo chmod +x backup.sh`

step 4: Run your script using the command: `./backup.sh`
