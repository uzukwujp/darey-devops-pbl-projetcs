## File Operations and Sorting

In this lesson, we will be writing a simple shell script that focuses on *File Operations and Sorting*.

This script creates three files (file1.txt, file2.txt, and file3.txt), displays the files in their current order, sorts them alphabetically, saves the sorted files in sorted_files.txt, displays the sorted files, removes the original files, renames the sorted file to sorted_files_sorted_alphabetically.txt, and finally displays the contents of the final sorted file.

Lets proceed using the steps below:

step 1:  Open your terminal and create a file called *sorting.sh* using the command `touch sorting.sh`

step 2: Copy and paste the code block below into the file

```
#!/bin/bash

# Create three files
echo "Creating files..."
echo "This is file3." > file3.txt
echo "This is file1." > file1.txt
echo "This is file2." > file2.txt
echo "Files created."

# Display the files in their current order
echo "Files in their current order:"
ls

# Sort the files alphabetically
echo "Sorting files alphabetically..."
ls | sort > sorted_files.txt
echo "Files sorted."

# Display the sorted files
echo "Sorted files:"
cat sorted_files.txt

# Remove the original files
echo "Removing original files..."
rm file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
echo "Original files removed."

# Rename the sorted file to a more descriptive name
echo "Renaming sorted file..."
mv sorted_files.txt sorted_files_sorted_alphabetically.txt
echo "File renamed."

# Display the final sorted file
echo "Final sorted file:"
cat sorted_files_sorted_alphabetically.txt

```

step 3: Set execute permission on *sorting.sh* using this command `sudo chmod +x sorting.sh`

step 4: Run your script using the command `./sorting.sh`
