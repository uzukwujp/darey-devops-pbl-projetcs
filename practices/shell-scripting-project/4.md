## Working with Numbers and Calculations

This script defines two variables num1 and num2 with numeric values, performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus), and displays the results. It also performs more complex calculations such as raising num1 to the power of 2 and calculating the square root of num2, and displays those results as well.

Lets proceed by following the steps below:

step 1:  On your terminal create a file called *calculations.sh* using the command `touch calculations.sh`

step 2:  Copy and paste the code block below:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Define two variables with numeric values
num1=10
num2=5

# Perform basic arithmetic operations
sum=$((num1 + num2))
difference=$((num1 - num2))
product=$((num1 * num2))
quotient=$((num1 / num2))
remainder=$((num1 % num2))

# Display the results
echo "Number 1: $num1"
echo "Number 2: $num2"
echo "Sum: $sum"
echo "Difference: $difference"
echo "Product: $product"
echo "Quotient: $quotient"
echo "Remainder: $remainder"

# Perform some more complex calculations
power_of_2=$((num1 ** 2))
square_root=$(awk "BEGIN{ sqrt=$num2; print sqrt }")

# Display the results
echo "Number 1 raised to the power of 2: $power_of_2"
echo "Square root of number 2: $square_root"

```

step 3: Set execute permission on *calculations.sh* using the command: `sudo chmod +x calculations.sh`

step 4: Run your script using this command: `./calculations.sh`
