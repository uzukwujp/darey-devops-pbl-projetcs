## Automate the Deployment of Webservers

In the implementing load balancer with Nginx course, We deployed two backend servers, with a load balancer distributing traffic across the webservers. We did that by typing commands right on our terminal.

In this course we will be automating the entire process. We will do that by writing a shell script that when ran, all that will did manually will be done for us automatically. As DevOps Engineers automation is at the heart of the work we do. Automation helps us speed the the deployment of services and reduce the chance of making errors in our day to day activity.

This course will give a great chance to learn automation.
