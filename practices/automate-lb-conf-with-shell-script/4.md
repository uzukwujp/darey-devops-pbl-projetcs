## Deploying and Configuring Nginx Load Balancer

All the steps followed in the **Implementing Load Balancer with Nginx** course has been codified in the script below:

Read the instrictions carefully in the script to learn how to use the script.

```

#!/bin/bash

######################################################################################################################
##### This automates the configuration of Nginx to act as a load balancer
##### Usage: The script is called with 3 command line arguments. The public IP of the EC2 instance where Nginx is installed
##### the webserver urls for which the load balancer distributes traffic. An example of how to call the script is shown below:
##### ./configure_nginx_loadbalancer.sh PUBLIC_IP Webserver-1 Webserver-2
#####  ./configure_nginx_loadbalancer.sh 127.0.0.1 192.2.4.6:8000  192.32.5.8:8000
############################################################################################################# 

PUBLIC_IP=$1
firstWebserver=$2
secondWebserver=$3

[ -z "${PUBLIC_IP}" ] && echo "Please pass the Public IP of your EC2 instance as the argument to the script" && exit 1

[ -z "${firstWebserver}" ] && echo "Please pass the Public IP together with its port number in this format: 127.0.0.1:8000 as the second argument to the script" && exit 1

[ -z "${secondWebserver}" ] && echo "Please pass the Public IP together with its port number in this format: 127.0.0.1:8000 as the third argument to the script" && exit 1

set -x # debug mode
set -e # exit the script if there is an error
set -o pipefail # exit the script when there is a pipe failure


sudo apt update -y && sudo apt install nginx -y
sudo systemctl status nginx

if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then
    sudo touch /etc/nginx/conf.d/loadbalancer.conf

    sudo chmod 777 /etc/nginx/conf.d/loadbalancer.conf
    sudo chmod 777 -R /etc/nginx/

    
    echo " upstream backend_servers {

            # your are to replace the public IP and Port to that of your webservers
            server  "${firstWebserver}"; # public IP and port for webserser 1
            server "${secondWebserver}"; # public IP and port for webserver 2

            }

           server {
            listen 80;
            server_name "${PUBLIC_IP}";

            location / {
                proxy_pass http://backend_servers;   
            }
    } " > /etc/nginx/conf.d/loadbalancer.conf
fi

sudo nginx -t

sudo systemctl restart nginx

```

### Steps to Run the Script

**Step 1:** On your terminal, open a file nginx.sh using the command below:

```
    sudo vi nginx.sh

```

**Step 2:** Copy and Paste the script inside the file

**Step 3:** Close the file using the command below:

```
    type esc the shift + :wqa!
```

**Step 4:** Change the file permission to make it an executable using the command below:

```
    sudo chmod +x nginx.sh
```

**Step 5:** Run the script with the command below:

```
./nginx.sh PUBLIC_IP Webserver-1 Webserver-2
```
