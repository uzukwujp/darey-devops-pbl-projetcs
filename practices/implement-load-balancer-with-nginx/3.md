## Load Balancing Algorithms

Load balancer algorithms are techniques used to distribute incoming network traffic or workload across multiple servers, ensuring efficient utilization of resources and improving overall system performance, reliability, and availability. Here are some common load balancer algorithms:

1. **Round Robin:** This algorithm distributes requests sequentially to each server in the pool. It is simple to implement and ensures an even distribution of traffic. It works well when all servers have similar capabilities and resources.

2. **Least Connections:** This algorithm routes new requests to the server with the least number of active connections. It is effective when servers have varying capacities or workloads, as it helps distribute traffic to the least busy server.

3. **Weighted Round Robin:** Similar to the Round Robin algorithm, but servers are assigned different weights based on their capabilities. Servers with higher capacities receive more requests. This approach is useful when servers have varying capacities or performance levels.

4. **Weighted Least Connections:** Similar to the Least Connections algorithm, but servers are assigned different weights based on their capabilities. Servers with higher capacities receive more connections. This approach balances traffic based on server capacities.

5. **IP Hash:** This algorithm uses a hash function based on the client's IP address to consistently map the client to a specific server. This ensures that the same client always reaches the same server, which can be helpful for maintaining session data or stateful connections.
