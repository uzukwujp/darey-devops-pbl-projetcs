## SSL Termination and HTTPS Load Balancing

In this module we will be configuring TLS/SSL on our deployed website. But before doing so, let us take a brief moment to understand the purpose of TLS certificate, how they work and the technology behinde it.

### Encryption

Encryption is at the heart of TLS/SSL. Encryption  is the process of converting plain, readable data (referred to as plaintext) into an unreadable format called ciphertext. The purpose of encryption is to ensure data confidentiality and protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or interception.

In encryption, an algorithm (known as a cryptographic algorithm) and a secret key are used to transform the plaintext into ciphertext. Only those who possess the correct key can decrypt the ciphertext and convert it back into its original plaintext form.

### Types of Encryption

Encryption can be classified into several types based on various criteria, such as the encryption process, the key used, and the level of security provided. Here are some common types of encryption:

#### 1. Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption processes. Both the sender and the receiver must possess the shared secret key. While symmetric encryption is generally faster than other methods, distributing and managing the secret key securely among all parties can be challenging. Examples of symmetric encryption algorithms include Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Data Encryption Standard (DES)

#### 2. Asymmetric Encryption

Asymmetric Encryption (Public-Key Encryption): Asymmetric encryption uses two distinct keys, a public key and a private key. The public key is used for encryption, while the private key is used for decryption. Anyone can use the recipient's public key to encrypt data, but only the recipient with the matching private key can decrypt and read the data. This method eliminates the need for secure key distribution but is computationally more intensive than symmetric encryption. Popular asymmetric encryption algorithms include RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).

#### 3. Hybrid Encryption


Hybrid encryption combines both symmetric and asymmetric encryption. In this approach, the sender generates a random symmetric key for each message and encrypts the actual data using this symmetric key (which is efficient for large amounts of data). Then, the sender encrypts the symmetric key using the recipient's public key and sends both the encrypted data and the encrypted symmetric key to the recipient. The recipient can decrypt the symmetric key using their private key and then use the symmetric key to decrypt the actual data. This method leverages the advantages of both symmetric and asymmetric encryption.

### The Purpose of TLS/SSL Certificate

The main purpose of TLS/SSL certificates is to encrypt the data transmitted between the web server and the client. This ensures that sensitive information, such as login credentials, personal data, or credit card details, remains confidential and protected from eavesdropping.

A secondary benefit is to establish trust between webservers and their client. Before data is transmitted between client and sever, the server needs to go through the process of authentication(server proves that its identity is genuine) by presenting its certificate to the cleint which is validate by a trusted Certificate Authority CA.

There are terms such as CA, certificate that you may not understand at the moment. But not to worry, all these will be explained in the next section.

### How TLS/SSL Work

TLS/SSL works with hybrid encryption. This means that both symmetric and Asymmetric encryption is used in TLS/SSL.

Before data is transmitted between client and server, the process of **TLS Handshake** is carried out.

During TLS handshake, the server shares with the client its digital certificate. The digital certificate contains the public key of the server.

The client(browser) verifies the validity of the servers public key using the public key of the **Certificate Authority** CA. If valid, the client encrypts it encryption key using the server's public key. This encrypted key is then sent to the server.

The client generates its encryption key using symmetric encryption. The implication is that its uses the same key for both encryption and decryption hence the need to encrypt its key using the server public key.

Since the server is the only entity in possession of its private key, It is able to decrypt the clients encrypted key.

After the handshake process is completed, the client encrypts every data it sends to the server. The server is then able to decrypt the data with the client's encryption key.

This ensures that only the server is able to make sense of the data shared by the client.
