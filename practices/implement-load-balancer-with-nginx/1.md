Load balancing is like having a team of helpers working together to make sure a big job gets done smoothly and efficiently. Imagine you have a lot of heavy boxes to carry, but you can't carry them all by yourself because they are too heavy.

Load balancing is when you call your friends to help you carry the boxes. Each friend takes some of the boxes and carries them to the right place. This way, the work gets done much faster because everyone is working together.

In computer terms, load balancing means distributing the work or tasks among several computers or servers so that no one computer gets overloaded with too much work. This helps to keep everything running smoothly and ensures that websites and apps work quickly and don't get too slow. It's like teamwork for computers!

Lets say you have a set of webservers serving a serving your website. In other to distribute the traffic evenly between the webservers, a load balancer is deployed. The load balancer stands in front of the webservers, all traffic gets to it first, it then distributes the traffic across the set of webservers. This is to ensure no webserver get over worked, consequently improving system performance.


Nginx is a versatile software, it can act like a webserver, reverse proxy, and a load balancer etc. All that is needed is to configure it properly to server your use case.

In this project we will be working you through how to configure Nginx as a load balancer.
