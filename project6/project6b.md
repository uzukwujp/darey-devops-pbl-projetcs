#### Step 1 — Prepare a Web Server 

1. Launch an EC2 instance that will serve as "Web Server". Create 3 volumes in the same AZ as your Web Server EC2, each of 10 GiB.

2. Attach all three volumes one by one to your Web Server EC2 instance

2. Open up the Linux terminal to begin configuration

3. Use [`lsblk`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/lsblk.8.html) command to inspect what block devices are attached to the server. Notice names of your newly created devices. All devices in Linux reside in /dev/ directory. Inspect it with `ls /dev/` and make sure you see all 3 newly created block devices there - their names will likely be `xvdf`, `xvdh`, `xvdg`.

4. Use [`df -h`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Df_(Unix)) command to see all mounts and free space on your server

5. Use `gdisk` utility to create a single partition on each of the 3 disks


```
sudo gdisk /dev/xvdf
```

Output
"""
GPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.3

Partition table scan:

Do you want to proceed? (Y/N): yes
OK; writing new GUID partition table (GPT) to /dev/xvdf.
The operation has completed successfully.
Now,  your changes has been configured succesfuly, exit out of the gdisk console and do the same for the remaining disks.
"""



5. Use `lsblk` utility to view the newly configured partition on each of the 3 disks.

6. Install [`lvm2`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Volume_Manager_(Linux)) package using `sudo yum install lvm2`. Run `sudo lvmdiskscan` command to check for available partitions.

**Note:** Previously, in Ubuntu we used `apt` command to install packages, in RedHat/CentOS a different package manager is used, so we shall use `yum` command instead.

7. Use [`pvcreate`](https://linux.die.net/man/8/pvcreate) utility to mark each of 3 disks as physical volumes (PVs) to be used by LVM

```
sudo pvcreate /dev/xvdf1
sudo pvcreate /dev/xvdg1
sudo pvcreate /dev/xvdh1

```

8. Verify that your Physical volume has been created successfully by running `sudo pvs`

<img src="https://darey-io-pbl-projects-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/project6/pvs.png" width="936px" height="550px">



9.  Use [`vgcreate`](https://linux.die.net/man/8/vgcreate) utility to add all 3 PVs to a volume group (VG). Name the VG **webdata-vg**

> 
```
sudo vgcreate webdata-vg /dev/xvdh1 /dev/xvdg1 /dev/xvdf1
```

10. Verify that your VG has been created successfully by running `sudo vgs`

<img src="https://darey-io-pbl-projects-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/project6/vgs.png" width="936px" height="550px">


11. Use [`lvcreate`](https://linux.die.net/man/8/lvcreate) utility to create 2 logical volumes.  **apps-lv** (***Use half of the PV size***), and **logs-lv** ***Use the remaining space of the PV size***. **NOTE**: apps-lv will be used to store data for the Website while, logs-lv will be used to store data for logs. 

```
sudo lvcreate -n apps-lv -L 14G webdata-vg
sudo lvcreate -n logs-lv -L 14G webdata-vg
```


12. Verify that your Logical Volume has been created successfully by running `sudo lvs`

<img src="https://darey-io-pbl-projects-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/project6/lvs.png" width="936px" height="550px">


13.  Verify the entire setup
```
sudo vgdisplay -v #view complete setup - VG, PV, and LV
sudo lsblk 
```
<img src="https://darey-io-pbl-projects-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/project6/lsblk3.png" width="936px" height="550px">




1.  Use `mkfs.ext4` to format the logical volumes with [ext4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext4) filesystem

```
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/webdata-vg/apps-lv
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/webdata-vg/logs-lv
```

15. Create **/var/www/html** directory to store website files

     `sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html`

16. Create **/home/recovery/logs** to store backup of log data


      `sudo mkdir -p /home/recovery/logs`


17. Mount **/var/www/html** on **apps-lv** logical volume

```
sudo mount /dev/webdata-vg/apps-lv /var/www/html/
```

18. Use [`rsync`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync) utility to backup all the files in the log directory **/var/log** into **/home/recovery/logs** (*This is required before mounting the file system*)

```
sudo rsync -av /var/log/. /home/recovery/logs/
```

19. Mount **/var/log** on **logs-lv** logical volume. (*Note that all the existing data on /var/log will be deleted. That is why step 15 above is very 
important*)

```
sudo mount /dev/webdata-vg/logs-lv /var/log
```

20. Restore log files back into **/var/log** directory

```
sudo rsync -av /home/recovery/logs/log/. /var/log
```

21. Update `/etc/fstab` file so that the mount configuration will persist after restart of the server.

The UUID of the  device will be used to update the `/etc/fstab` file;


`sudo blkid`

<img src="https://darey-io-pbl-projects-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/project6/blkid.png" width="936px" height="550px">



sudo vi `/etc/fstab`

Update `/etc/fstab` in this format using your own UUID and rememeber to remove the leading and ending quotes.

22.  Test the configuration and reload the daemon
   
     ```
     sudo mount -a
     sudo systemctl daemon-reload
     ```

23.   Verify your setup by running `df -h`, output must look like this:
